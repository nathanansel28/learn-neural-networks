    "\n",
    "In this section, we took a significant step \n",
    "towards designing deep learning systems \n",
    "by implementing a fully functional \n",
    "neural network model and training loop.\n",
    "In this process, we built a data loader, \n",
    "a model, a loss function, an optimization procedure,\n",
    "and a visualization and monitoring tool. \n",
    "We did this by composing a Python object \n",
    "that contains all relevant components for training a model. \n",
    "While this is not yet a professional-grade implementation\n",
    "it is perfectly functional and code like this \n",
    "could already help you to solve small problems quickly.\n",
    "In the coming sections, we will see how to do this\n",
    "both *more concisely* (avoiding boilerplate code)\n",
    "and *more efficiently* (using our GPUs to their full potential).\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What would happen if we were to initialize the weights to zero. Would the algorithm still work? What if we\n",
    "   initialized the parameters with variance $1000$ rather than $0.01$?\n",
    "1. Assume that you are [Georg Simon Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm) trying to come up\n",
    "   with a model for resistance that relates voltage and current. Can you use automatic\n",
    "   differentiation to learn the parameters of your model?\n",
    "1. Can you use [Planck's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law) to determine the temperature of an object\n",
    "   using spectral energy density? For reference, the spectral density $B$ of radiation emanating from a black body is\n",
    "   $B(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{2 hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\cdot \\left(\\exp \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k T} - 1\\right)^{-1}$. Here\n",
    "   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $T$ is the temperature, $c$ is the speed of light, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $k$ is the\n",
    "   Boltzmann constant. You measure the energy for different wavelengths $\\lambda$ and you now need to fit the spectral\n",
    "   density curve to Planck's law.\n",
    "1. What are the problems you might encounter if you wanted to compute the second derivatives of the loss? How would\n",
    "   you fix them?\n",
    "1. Why is the `reshape` method needed in the `loss` function?\n",
    "1. Experiment using different learning rates to find out how quickly the loss function value drops. Can you reduce the\n",
    "   error by increasing the number of epochs of training?\n",
    "1. If the number of examples cannot be divided by the batch size, what happens to `data_iter` at the end of an epoch?\n",
    "1. Try implementing a different loss function, such as the absolute value loss `(y_hat - d2l.reshape(y, y_hat.shape)).abs().sum()`.\n",
    "    1. Check what happens for regular data.\n",
    "    1. Check whether there is a difference in behavior if you actively perturb some entries, such as $y_5 = 10000$, of $\\mathbf{y}$.\n",
    "    1. Can you think of a cheap solution for combining the best aspects of squared loss and absolute value loss?\n",
    "       Hint: how can you avoid really large gradient values?\n",
    "1. Why do we need to reshuffle the dataset? Can you design a case where a maliciously constructed dataset would break the optimization algorithm otherwise?\n"
